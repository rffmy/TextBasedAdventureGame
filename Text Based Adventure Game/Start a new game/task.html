<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>In this stage, you will implement the new game function and the game stats.</p>
<p>You need a game function that allows you to store all the necessary items and use them in your playthrough. The game stats will be saved once the player advances to another level.</p>
<p>You need to store important variables when creating a new game such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The username. You will need it in a later stage for the save file path.</li>
<li>The character attributes: <code class="java">Name</code>, <code class="java">Species</code>, and the <code class="java">Gender</code>.</li>
<li>The inventory: <code class="java">Snack</code>, <code class="java">Weapon</code>, and <code class="java">Tool</code>.</li>
<li>The difficulty level: <code class="java">1- Easy</code>, <code class="java">2- Medium</code> and <code class="java">3- Hard</code>. The user needs to select the difficulty level either by the word or the index.</li>
<li>The remaining lives: <code class="java">5</code> for an easy difficulty level, <code class="java">3</code> for a medium one, and <code class="java">1</code> for a hard one. You don't need to take the number of lives as input, it should be calculated on the basis of the level that the user chooses.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should get the game variables in the same order as in the Examples. If a player makes a mistake by choosing to create a new game, give them an option to go back to the main menu before creating a new player: <code class="java">Enter a user name to save your progress or type '/b' to go back</code>.</p>
<p>The Level starts with 1 (the first level). The game is going to have 2 levels in total at the end.</p>
<p>Don't forget to handle incorrect input as before!</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create and store the game state with variables such as the inventory, character attributes, difficulty, remaining lives, and the username.</li>
<li>Have the option to go back to the menu before creating a new game. Don't forget that it should handle all the letter cases.</li>
<li>Before the new game starts, output the message <code class="java">Good luck on your journey!</code> with the game stats below such as the character traits, inventory, difficulty, and the number of lives. Take a look at the Examples below to find out how you need to format the output.</li>
</ol>
