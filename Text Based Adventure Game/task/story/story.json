        "scene1": "Once you reach the beginning of the Mount Qaf, you feel amazed by the majestic\nmountain that you will conquer, at the end of this climb. You look at the snowy peaks while\nthinking of how to start the journey. There is a hill before you.",
        "scene2": "As you go up the mountain, you see weird plants and flowers coming out of the surface of the mountain.\nSuddenly, you hear a thunder-like growl and feel the breeze of giant wings behind you.\nYou tilt your head up and see a dragon flying towards the top of the mountain.\nYou've heard stories that this, is no ordinary mountain and they seem to be true.\nYou've reached a higher level of the mountain and saw a door with a lock, hanging in the air, unattached.\nYou also saw a path up to the mountain however; there is a human-sized bird in front of it.",
        "scene3": "Once again, you have climbed up on the mountain.\nThe air started to feel heavier. A cold breeze crawled up on your neck as it was snowing.\nYou hugged your arms around your chest, wishing to pack a thicker jacket.\nIn the distance, you saw a cave and filled with hope to get in and get warm.\nThe cave's entrance small, however, the inside was vast, filled with icicles on the ceiling.\nYou sat down on a rock trying to get warm and all of a sudden you felt as if you weren't alone.\nYou stand still to listen to hear its breathing. Then you hear a big laugh echoing on the surface of the cave.\nDarkness says \"There come many travellers here to conquer this mountain, however very few can pass this point\".\nYou were too scared to answer. The voice continued \"Answer my riddle correctly and I'll let you pass, it's that simple!\nAs small as your thumb, I am light in the air,\nyou may hear me before you see me, but trust that I'm there.\nWhat am I?\""
