<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>In this stage, you are going to implement the core game features and only the first level of the game.</p>
<p>You are not supposed to save the game yet, that will come later.</p>
<p>First, you need to read the contents of the <code class="java"><a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/489000/story.json" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">story.json</a></code> file. Download the file from the link and place it in a new subfolder <code class="java">story</code> in your project directory. In this JSON file, you can see all of the items related to the story. In the <code class="java">story</code> key, you will find each of the necessary scenes for the first level. Each level has 3 scenes.</p>
<p>When opening the JSON file for reading, make sure to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">os.path.join()</a> to build the path to where you've saved the file.</p>
<p>In the <code class="java">choices</code> key, you will find the different choices of actions that the player can take. Also, you will see some of the words are wrapped in curly brackets like <code class="java">{weapon}</code>. This means that you need to output the player's choice of weapon in these sentences. Output the right object in place of the bracketed word. Inspect or edit the JSON file to see or change what keywords are used as placeholders.</p>
<p>In the <code class="java">outcomes</code> key, you will find the outcomes for each of the choices available to the player (i.e. <code class="java">outcome1</code> from <code class="java">lvl1</code>, <code class="java">scene1</code> is the outcome of <code class="java">choice1</code> for <code class="java">lvl1</code>). Each outcome string contains an expression in parentheses, for example: <code class="java">(life+1)</code>. These indicate what effect each outcome has on the game's flow and the variables tracking the game's state (like the number of lives remaining). Your program needs to take them out of the sentences before you print the outcome since they are not a part of the story.</p>
<p>Below is the table of the possible outcome effects:</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><em>life +1</em></td>
<td>increases the number of lives</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>life -1</em></td>
<td>decreases the number of lives</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>inventory +</em> 'item_name'</td>
<td>adds a new item to inventory</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>inventory - </em>'item_name'</td>
<td>removes an item from inventory</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>move</em></td>
<td>moves to the next segment of the story</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>repeat</em></td>
<td>repeat the choices that were made in this segment of the story</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>save</em></td>
<td>indicates the end of a level, saves the game</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>game_won</em></td>
<td>a player has beaten the game, exits the program</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These outcomes can be combined together to make two actions at the same time. For example: <code class="java">(life+1 and move)</code></p>
<p>Keep in mind that some of the outcomes, such as <code class="java">save</code> and  <code class="java">game_won</code>, are going to appear in later stages. So, don't worry about them now.</p>
<p>In addition, you will see an outcome that is separated into different options: </p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">option1: You tried the key on the lock and the door opened.(inventory-'key' and move)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">option2: You don't have a key to open the lock. (repeat)</code></pre>
<p>This means that an action made by the player has two outcomes depending on the player's previous actions. In this instance, for the option1 to happen, the player should have a key in the inventory. However, if the player doesn't have a key, the option2 happens.</p>
<p>Once you have the story, you can move to the core game loop. The game loop should check for the number of lives and if there are no lives remaining, the game is over. Also, check for the level of the game. If the player reaches the second level, your game should show it. However, since you are only implementing the first level in this stage, just output the <code class="java">Level 2</code> message and end the program.</p>
<p>Don't forget to print the <code class="java">Goodbye!</code> message every time your program ends</p>
<p>Once the core game loop is set up, it's time to implement the gameplay features. Introduce your story to a player, then give a player some options to continue the game. <u>The options should be numbered so that the player can type the number to choose the option. <strong>Limit the options to three, just to keep it simple and show the outcome.</strong></u></p>
<p>If your character dies, the game should start from the beginning of the level, decrease the number of the remaining lives but preserve the content of the inventory.</p>
<p>You also need to implement the following commands: <code class="java">/i</code>, <code class="java">/c</code>, <code class="java">/h</code>:</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code class="java">/i</code></td>
<td>shows the content of the inventory</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="java">/c</code></td>
<td>shows the character traits and the remaining lives</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="java">/h</code></td>
<td>the help page; shows the commands available to a player</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The player should be able to exit the game by typing <code class="java">/q</code> anytime. Don't forget to ask for the confirmation. Don't forget to show a message when an unknown input occurs.</p>
<p><u><strong>You can always write your own story for this project</strong></u>. In fact, it is encouraged to do so. However, make sure that you use the same character traits and inventory items in your story. Also, make sure that in your story, the player always has the weapon, the tool and the snack.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the story folder content.</li>
